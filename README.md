# FeedReader Testing
## What is it?
This is Udacity's RSS feed reader application. It uses the Google Feed Reader API to grab RSS feeds as a JSON object that we can make use of.

The implemented Jasmine testing ensures basic functionality of the page, including loading of the Feed, valid URL links for each feed, and an unobtrusive page menu.

Currently hosted on gh pages at https://arafhossain.github.io/Feedreader-testing/

## Dependencies
This application requires 'Jasmine' installed as a dependency if viewed locally. Please refer to 'https://jasmine.github.io/setup/nodejs.html' for the instructions.
