# FeedReader.js README
This is Udacity's RSS feed reader application. It uses the Google Feed Reader API to grab RSS feeds as a JSON object that we can make use of. It also uses the Handlebars templating library and jQuery.

The Jasmine testing ensures basic functionality of the page, including loading of the Feed, valid URL links for each feed, and an unobtrusive page menu.

This application requires 'Jasmine' installed as a dependency. Please refer to 'https://jasmine.github.io/setup/nodejs.html' for the instructions.
