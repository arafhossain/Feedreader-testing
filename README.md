# FeedReader.js README
This is our RSS feed reader application. It uses the Google Feed Reader API to grab RSS feeds as JSON object we can make use of. It also uses the Handlebars templating library and jQuery.

The Jasmine testing ensures basic functionality of the page, including loading of the Feed, valid URL links for each feed, and a unobtrusive page menu.

This reader requires 'Jasmine' installed as a dependency. Please refer to 'https://jasmine.github.io/setup/nodejs.html' for the instructions.
